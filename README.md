# Star_Life_Cycle
Program that simulates a star life cycle. Starts with a gas cloud and eventually dies in a supernova. To start the star life cycle press the spacebar. Can exit at anytime using esc.
Added a jar file so it's easy to run by just double clicking on the jar file (assuming you can run jar files).
Here's a youtube video of me explaining the process and a little bit of the program https://youtu.be/UU0OTRrI6Rs
