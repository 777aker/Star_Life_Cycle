# Star_Life_Cycle
Program that simulates a star life cycle. Starts with a gas cloud and eventually dies in a supernova. To start the star life cycle press the spacebar. Can exit at anytime using esc.
Added a jar file so it's easy to run by just double clicking on the jar file (assuming you can run jar files).
Here's a youtube video of me explaining the process and a little bit of the program https://youtu.be/UU0OTRrI6Rs
Future plans: centralize force variables so that you can see all sorts of different processes. ie: what happens when pressure too great for gravity, what if fusion was stronger, what if gravity was stronger, so on just to simulate other types of stuff. Currently pretty easy for me to do but not easy for someone else to do who doesn't know the program well.
